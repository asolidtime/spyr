In order to add a song from here, paste a YouTube link into the text box at the bottom and hit 'Add song!'.  
Songs will be added one after another to the queue (big box in the center). You can hit 'Start' or click on a song in the queue to start playback.
  
After adding a few songs, you'll notice the 'Recently Listened' tab start to fill up with songs you listen to.
