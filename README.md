# Spyr

Spyr (sounds like 'spire') is a music streaming client built in Java and Swing that was inspired by (and aims to be a replacement to) the music streaming bots popular on Discord. It's also an effort for me to teach myself more about Java.

**Alright, where can I get it?**

You can grab a stable release from [here.](https://github.com/asolidtime/spyr/releases) If you want the absolute latest version, click [this link.](https://nightly.link/asolidtime/spyr/workflows/github-actions/main/JAR%20package.zip) Note that both require [Java 8 or newer](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot) and [the latest version of VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) to be installed.

- [x] Screenshots! (and just a bette readme in general)
- [ ] Search for songs (preferably without needing a rate-limited API)
