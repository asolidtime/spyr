# Spyr

Spyr (sounds like 'spire') is a music streaming client built in Java and Swing that aims to be a functional replacement to the music streaming bots popular on Discord. It's also an effort for me to teach myself more about Java.

**Alright, where can I get it?**

You can grab a stable release from [here.](https://github.com/asolidtime/spyr/releases) If you want the absolute latest version, click [this link.](https://nightly.link/asolidtime/spyr/workflows/github-actions/main/JAR%20package.zip) Note that both require [the latest version of Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot) and [VLC 3.0.0 or newer](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) to be installed.

## Roadmap (in no particular order)

- [x] Basic audio playback from Youtube
- [ ] check to see if vlc is installed, and possibly try to bundle libvlc with the jar
- [ ] An icon! (and possibly some sort of banner to show at the top)
- [ ] Screenshots! (and just a bette readme in general)
- [ ] A better README! (this one has too many parentheses and maybe a few too many exclamation points!)
- [ ] Search YouTube (preferably without needing an API key)
- [ ] Support Spotify playlists and tracks (probably using the Spotify Web API or Odesli and searching YT for the songs)
- [ ] Support playlists at all
- [x] Show frequently played songs (and playlists once that gets included)
- [ ] Show previous listening sessions
- [ ] Show track thumbnail/info
- [ ] Integrate with system media playback controls
- [ ] support drag n' dropping songs, both stuff from JLists within the app and links from outside apps
- [ ] discord integration?
