# what is this?
I made this project for two reasons. First and foremost, I wanted ad-free, queue-based music streaming back (given that YouTube has finally gotten around to DMCAing all the music bots) in a way that was accessible to people who don't have the time or knowledge to self-host a music bot. 
Second off, I wanted to test out my recently-gained Java 'skills' (emphasis on the quotes there) by making a presentable, useful GUI app.
## Roadmap
- [x] first of all, actually upload the project to GH
