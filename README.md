# Spyr
Spyr is a music streaming client built in Java and Swing that aims to be a functional replacement to the music streaming bots popular on Discord. It's also an effort for me to teach myself more about Java.
## Roadmap (in no particular order)

- [x] Basic audio playback from Youtube
- [ ] Search YouTube (preferably without needing an API key)
- [ ] Support Spotify playlists and tracks (probably using the Spotify Web API and searching YT for the songs)
- [ ] Support playlists at all
- [ ] Show frequently played songs and playlists / previous listening sessions
- [ ] Show track thumbnail/info
- [ ] Integrate with system media playback controls
