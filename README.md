# what is this?
Unless you live under a rock (or are one of the 7.3 billion people who've never used Discord before, but that one's a *little* far fetched), you've heard about YouTube DMCAing Discord music bots. Many have shut down entirely, and others have started grabbing music from lower-quality sources. And, in my opinion, these are both subpar solutions.
I made this project for two reasons. First and foremost, I wanted ad-free, queue-based music streaming back in a way that was accessible to people who don't have the time or knowledge to self-host a music bot. Second off, I wanted to test out my recently-gained Java 'skills' (emphasis on the quotes there) by making a presentable, useful GUI app.
## Roadmap
- [ ] first of all, actually upload the project to GH
